Bookify is an innovative web application designed to transform the reading experience by providing users with personalized playlists based on their book or movie selections. 
The application allows users to input the title and author of a book to generate a Spotify playlist that aligns with the vibe, themes, and plot
of their chosen content. This unique feature is powered by the ChatGPT API, enabling the selection of songs that perfectly resonate with the user's input. Seamless integration
with Spotify is achieved through the Spotify API OAuth, ensuring that the customized playlists are automatically uploaded and saved to the user's Spotify account. Beyond just 
creating playlists, Bookify is dedicated to building a community of passionate readers and music enthusiasts. It maintains a database for users to rate and comment on the playlists, 
fostering user engagement and providing insights for ongoing enhancements to the service. The development and functionality of Bookify are meticulously guided to ensure an immersive and 
distinct experience for every user, making it a standout application for those looking to combine their love for reading and music.
